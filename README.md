## NESFPGA

Lets build a Nintedo from scratch! Uses my [6502 core](https://github.com/jpdoane/6502).  Base HDMI code is borrowed from [here](https://github.com/hdl-util/hdmi), modified to upscale native NES 240p to 720p.

Current status: builds and SMB runs on an Arty Z7, but still working out some rendering bugs.  No audio yet.
